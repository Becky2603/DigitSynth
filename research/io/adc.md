# ADCs
Struggling to find an ADC with a data-ready pin, all seem to be query-based. 

Checked: 
- MCP3008I (microchip)
- ADC128S022 (TI)
- MCP320418 (microchip) 
- ADS78301PWT (TI) 

Possibility of using ADS1256 (TI)
- Programmable timer
- Provides data-ready
- A little pricey (approx. £16)

Could build our own oscillator for timing
- 555 or similar
- Crystal oscillator (maybe too fast)
